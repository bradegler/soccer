# Soccer Team Manager

This is a mobile application written using Flutter.

The primary purpose is to track team and individual level statistics about soccer players for U6, U8 and U10+ soccer levels. 

Phase 1 of this app should only utilize device level storage and should not attempt to connect to a backend service. Syncing to a central repository is something that can be considered in the future but is not currently a requirement.

## Things to track

* Leagues
* Teams in a League
* Players on a Team
* Games played
* Goals scored
* Player ranking A,B,C etc
* Minutes played

## Other things to create

Game level manager interface.

* Time periods
* Track player rotations through the bench and positions

## Future requirements

* Schedule tracking

* Field condition notifications
